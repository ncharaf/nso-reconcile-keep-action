# NSO Reconcile Keep Action

This is a package that I created to show how we can create actions that limit NSO default service actions and expose them to some users.

In this case, we want to expose "service re-deploy reconcile" but not given the option for "discard-non-service-config"

Note: I assumed that "deviation" would not work with NSO native actions but I have not test that option
